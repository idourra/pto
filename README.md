Python timeline organizer. 
Collection of modules (a “package”) for the uniform handling of image files and image data
Python script to organize images in folders by year, month and day.
The script has as input a valid source path name and destination path name. 
If the original image file has exif metadata containing the date of creation, 
the file will be stored in the corresponding folder, eg. year/month/date/image_file. 
If the image file does not have date metadata, it is stored in a none_exif_date folder.
